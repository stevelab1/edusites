# Edusites

Education platform built on Django

Up-to-date settings and requirements for deploying to heroku

Currently, running on Django 3.1.4 and Python 3.9

Check dependencies e.g. search requires Postgres and cloud-settings require keys, or to be swapped out for local dev settings 

`createsuperuser` then navigate to /admin to add data, or use shell

Contains obsolete code (to be removed)

All the best,

Stephen Tallett
